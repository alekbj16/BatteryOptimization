# BatteryOptimization
My bachelor project consisted of creating an autonomous price-driven charging/discharging prediction for a stationary battery storage system. In Norway, electricity prices for the day-ahead market is published with a 24-hour resolution. These prices where extracted from a server, and used in an optimization routine to find the best charging/discharging scenarios (with potential earnings as the main incentive) for the battery storage system. The work recieved an A.  

At the time of the project, I had little to no experience with programming, so there are probably several potential imporevments to be done. However, working with this project and for the first time really experiencing programming is what inspired me to step into the world of data for my masters degree, and I'm confident that my learning curve will be steep.
