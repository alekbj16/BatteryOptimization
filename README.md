# BatteryOptimization
My bachelor project consisted of creating an autonomous price-driven charging/discharging prediction for a stationary battery storage system. In Norway, electricity prices for the day-ahead market is published with a 24-hour resolution. These prices where extracted from a server, and used in an optimization routine to find the best charging/discharging scenarios (with potential earnings as the main incentive) for the battery storage system.
